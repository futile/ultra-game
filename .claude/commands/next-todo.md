Implement the next todo by following the steps below.

DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES BEFORE STEP 6 (implementation). IF NECESSARY, EXPLICITLY ASK BEFOREHAND.

1. Read the next todo, including sub-todos, from docs/notes.md in the "Next"-section.
2. Show it to the user, and ask for any adjustments or extra context the user wants to give.
3. Gather context that you need to solve the issue. Especially check if a relevant file is linked in CLAUDE.md, or a file in docs/ has a relevant-sounding file name.
4. Show the context to the user, and ask if it is ok/if any changes are desired.
5. Present possible trade-offs and required decisions to the user, confirm what the user wants.
6. Write a hierarchical implementation plan and ask for confirmation by the user.
